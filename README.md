# The Rapid Report

A simple and responsive news website that fetches and displays the latest headlines using the News API. The website is styled with Tailwind CSS and includes smooth hover effects for an enhanced user experience.

## Features

- Fetches real-time news articles using the [News API](https://newsapi.org/)
- Responsive grid layout using **Tailwind CSS**
- Hover effects to enlarge news cards
- Displays images, titles, descriptions, and links to full articles
- Links to author's **GitHub** and **LinkedIn** profiles

## Live Demo

You can deploy the project using **GitHub Pages**, **Netlify**, or **Vercel**.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - Structure of the webpage
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling and responsive layout
- **JavaScript (ES6)** - Fetching and displaying news dynamically
- **News API** - Source for real-time news updates

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Arnav400/news-website.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd news-website
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## How It Works

1. The script fetches news articles from the News API.
2. Each article is displayed in a **responsive grid**.
3. Hovering over an article enlarges the news card for better visibility.
4. Clicking on **"Read More"** redirects the user to the full article.

## API Key Configuration

By default, the project uses a placeholder API key:
```js
const API_KEY = '5ef3abc0a6fa4cbfb77ed74f309c825e';
```
If you face issues, replace it with your own API key from [News API](https://newsapi.org/).
